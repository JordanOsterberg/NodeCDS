### upload.js
This script allows for content to be saved to the system for retreival later.

upload.js will expand across as many ports as instances are requested using pm2.
E.g. if port 3000 is specified, and 4 instances are requested, then ports 3000, 3001, 3002, and 3003 will all run an instance of upload.js

### delivery.js
This script delivers content to the end-user.

delivery.js will expand across as many ports as instances are requested using pm2.
E.g. if port 3000 is specified, and 4 instances are requested, then ports 3000, 3001, 3002, and 3003 will all run an instance of delivery.js

### A front-facing proxy/load balancer such as Nginx or HAProxy should be used in front of both of these scripts. Example Nginx configuration files can be found in example/cfg/nginx. They should be editted for production.
